# 🛰️ Mini Docs Portal

This project is a simplified documentation hub built using [Astro](https://astro.build/). It’s used during technical interviews for developer candidates applying to UP42's Developer Experience & Documentation team.

The goal is to simulate real-world tasks like structuring content, rendering MDX, and improving the overall developer experience of our documentation portal.
