# 🛰️ Mini Docs Portal

This project is a simplified documentation hub built using [Astro](https://astro.build/). It’s used during technical interviews for developer candidates applying to UP42's Developer Experience & Documentation team.

The goal is to simulate real-world tasks like structuring content, rendering MDX, and improving the overall developer experience of our documentation portal.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

- 📝 MDX-based documentation pages (`intro.mdx`, `quickstart.mdx`)
- 🔗 Basic sidebar navigation
- ⚛️ Astro layout components
- 🧱 Simple routing based on slug
- 🧪 Room for enhancements like search, code samples, or feedback widgets
